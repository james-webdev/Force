This market features a revolutionary technology called the field programmable gate array (FPGA) that our company pioneered in 1984. Xilinx has almost half of the $2.3 billion PLD market.   Xilinx is the world's leading innovator of programmable logic solutions. We supply customers with ""off-the-shelf"" logic devices that customers can program to perform specific functions using the development tools we provide.   This programmability provides a revolutionary alternative to fixed or custom logic devices that typically require many months to design, test, and manufacture. Xilinx customers enjoy the benefit of faster time-to-market and increased product design flexibility as a result.  Uses for Programmable Logic  Our company's business is drawn from a variety of industry segments. In recent years, a large portion of our revenues came from the communications marketplace. However, we have become increasingly more diversified to include the consumer, industrial, and automotive sectors.   You can find Xilinx chips in a wide variety of digital electronic applications ranging from wireless base stations to DVD players.  Multiple Product LInes with Superlative Software Support  Our extensive product line includes silicon solutions like the Virtex? series FPGAs (high performance FPGAs for networking, communications, and video/imaging applications at the lowest cost); Spartan? FPGAs (ideal for high volume applications); and CoolRunner? and C9500? CPLD families (Complex Programmable Logic Devices that offer ultra low cost and low power). We also create a powerful suite of of high performance software design tools.  High-profile Worldwide Customer and Partner Base  Xilinx has over 7,500 customers around the globe, including Alcatel, Cisco Systems, EMC, Ericsson, Fujitsu, Hewlett-Packard, IBM, Lucent Technologies, and Motorola. Most of our sales are handled by outside partners: both large distributors and independent sales representatives.  The company has a very flexible business model that has contributed to our success as an employer and a competitor. We are a ""fabless"" supplier and do not manufacture our logic devices. Instead, we have formed close strategic alliances with chip manufacturers like IBM and UMC. This strategy, along with outsourcing most of sales, allows us to focus more of our energies on R&D, marketing and technical support. The resulting flexibility gives us the ability to rearrange business priorities quickly as we respond to the cyclical nature of the semiconductor market. It also has made it easier for us to avoid layoffs in periods of downturn.   Our Vision for the Future  What essentially defines Xilinx is vision. Our long-term business goal is to put a PLD in every piece of electronic equipment within the next 10 years. Our long-term management goal is to create a company that sets the standard for managing high technology companies. While these are ambitious undertakings, at Xilinx, visions have a way of turning into reality.",,,00550000000vRURAA2,8/24/2006 1:27,00550000000vRUqAAM,6/17/2014 17:08,00550000000vRURAA2,6/17/2014 17:08,1/21/2009 0:00,,,,,,,,,

""Very few technology companies have been able to grow revenue during what is arguably the worst economy since the Great Depression. Our annual revenue growth of 5 percent clearly demonstrates ShoreTel's ability to sustain growth despite the weak economic environment,"" said John W. Combs, chief executive officer of ShoreTel. ""Other positive indicators in the fourth quarter included a substantial increase in order volume, our newly announced agreement with IBM, our ability to achieve the highest levels of customer satisfaction in ShoreTel's history while at the same time efficiently cutting cost out of our business, and most importantly, the expansion of our distribution channel with the addition of two new telecommunications carriers. With these new additions, ShoreTel products and services are now being sold by all of the top three U.S. wireline telecommunications providers.""  ""With so many identifiable opportunities right in front of us, now is the time to invest in our future. We are increasing our investments in sales personnel, branding, and channel development over the coming quarters in order to fully realize our sales growth potential in calendar 2010 and beyond,"" continued Combs.  Operational Highlights for Fiscal Year 2009  Extended Reach  The company added two new telecommunications carriers in the United States during its fourth quarter, significantly improving its access to enterprise businesses domestically. With these additions, all three of the top U.S. telecommunications carriers now carry ShoreTel products and services. Additionally, the company enhanced its overall distribution network with the addition of nearly 250 partners worldwide during its fiscal year.  In July, ShoreTel announced an agreement with IBM to integrate ShoreTel's Unified Communications system with the new Lotus Foundations Reach product offering. The result will be an out-of-the box solution that combines a full range of IT, email, office productivity and collaboration applications, such as Lotus Sametime, with ShoreTel's brilliantly simple UC solution. The combined solution is expected to be targeted globally at small to midsize businesses as well as branch offices of larger enterprises, where IT resources and skills are often limited.  Enhanced Technology  During the year, the company introduced two new versions of its UC software. With ShoreTel 8.1 and ShoreTel 9.0, the company added significant enhancements to its award-winning UC solution, including global support for the desktop client, expanded language support, enhanced personalization features and customizable call routing, as well as support for integration with Microsoft Office Communications Server (OCS) and IBM Lotus Sametime.  ShoreTel also augmented its ShoreTel Converged Conferencing solution with the introduction of ShoreTel Converged Conferencing 7.1, which allows users to quickly host audio and Web conferences, chat via IM, and share documents seamlessly using ShoreTel's UC desktop.  The company also introduced ShoreWare(R) Contact Center 5, the latest version of its contact center application suite designed to help organizations significantly improve customer service and sales workflows.  In addition to introducing new phones, including the ShorePhone(R) IP 230g and its first VPN phone, ShoreTel announced a new family of ShoreGear(R) Voice Switches that extends the company's unique single-image distributed architecture to voicemail and auto-attendant applications.  In May, the company showcased its interoperability with IBM Lotus Sametime and Microsoft OCS at Interop Las Vegas. ShoreTel's streamlined integration capabilities are based on open standards to provide enterprises with greater choice and flexibility in how they provide new UC capabilities to their users.  Market Share Growth  ShoreTel has grown its market share during its fiscal year, growing its Pure IP market share in the United States to approximately 7.5 percent, based upon data provided by Synergy Research. This achievement is significant considering that the worldwide Pure IP market declined 26 percent and the U.S. market declined 24 percent over the past 12 months. Additionally, ShoreTel has the No. 1 market share position worldwide for small and midsize businesses using UC desktop solutions, at 18 percent, according to Synergy Research.  Expanded Customer Base  The company added nearly 3,000 customers during the year, including AT&T Park, home of the San Francisco Giants, and the Verizon Center, home of the Washington Wizards and Washington Capitals. The company has now sold to nearly 11,000 customers worldwide and has granted user licenses to more than 1 million end users.",,,00550000000vRUNAA2,8/29/2006 23:14,00550000000vRURAA2,3/6/2018 23:11,00550000000vRURAA2,3/6/2018 23:11,9/29/2006 0:00,,,,,,,,,

Founded in 1979, Triton is a pioneer of the highest quality and most cost-effective technological products in the world. Since 1994, we have become one of the largest manufacturers of ATMs with over 158,000 installations in more than 24 countries, a worldwide leader in the design and manufacture of innovative ATM products and solutions. Known for our reliable and serviceable units, we also enjoy the support and strength of The Dover Corporation, an organization with annual revenues of over $5.5 billion.  Triton enjoys strong brand recognition in the United States, United Kingdom, Australia, South Africa and Canada. Our brand strength is based on a clear and concise philosophy promoted carefully in every market and country we serve.  In a move to enhance service and support operations in the European ATM market, Triton has acquired the ATM estate, repair and warehousing operations of InfoCash.  This acquisition is part of Triton?s long-term strategy to build on their global success in the ATM industry and provide high-quality, cost-effective ATM equipment, processing and service for the ATM market.  Triton will continue to sell ATM solutions for the retail market exclusively through IAD (Independent ATM Deployer) partners.  The March 2006 acquisition enabled Triton to provide direct in-country warehousing, parts, repair and technical service related support for all of their products.  It will offer further in-country support services for IADs to grow their retail ATM business.  For the most reliable and highest quality ATMs, nothing beats a Triton. We build them from the ground up to provide the lowest total cost of ownership in the marketplace. Triton continues to set new standards with innovative features and support after the sale. Additionally, Triton is known throughout the industry as a leader in the area of regulatory compliance. We make sure our machines meet all current and proposed regulations, so compliance will never be an issue. We simply have the total ATM solution.  With a sleek look and a small footprint, Triton ATMs are known for ease of servicing and the least amount of downtime of any ATMs. You can count on our friendly and knowledgeable tech support call center to resolve technical issues that may arise. Thanks to superior engineering, Triton ATMs average less than one service call per year per ATM, with more than 90 percent of all technical difficulties reported resolved by telephone.  Triton has been a trusted name in the business world, providing reliable and affordable products, for more than 20 years. Today, Triton stands behind a complete line of ATM products specifically designed for the needs of financial institutions and retail locations.  Extraordinary technology. Extraordinarily useful.  Since our founding in 1979, Triton has been known for it innovations. In the early days of our company, we developed and built remarkable scientific equipment for demanding clients like Exxon, General Electric, Magnavox, and the U.S. Navy. They learned that Triton not only has the technological know-how to solve problems, but also has a rare passion for developing technology that makes sense ? solutions that are as practical and affordable as they are sophisticated.  So it?s no wonder the banking industry turned to Triton in 1985 for the development of the world?s first battery powered and completely portable device for training consumers on an all-new technology: Automated Teller Machines. The ATMjr. helped spur a revolution in the banking industry, and it?s still used in more than 1,800 financial institutions worldwide.  We proved to be such a good fit with the financial industry that over the next few years, we began to focus exclusively on financial services. Almost immediately, we began to deliver innovations that changed the industry.  Triton ATMjr. Plus CASIn 1989, Triton developed CAS, the Card Activation System that allows financial institutions to instantly issue ATM cards with custom PINs. Combined with the ATMjr., the technology provided a powerful automated training aid and instant issue solution.  In 1992, we pioneered in-store cash withdrawals with the introduction of the Scrip terminal, a machine that allows a store?s customers to use an ATM card to generate a voucher that is redeemable for cash at the register. Soon, thousands of Scrip terminals were installed across the country in convenience stores and casinos providing the consumer with a new outlet for making cash withdrawals.  Triton SuperScrip TerminalIn 1994, consumers? need to access their funds through easy and quick cash withdrawals led Triton to develop a revolutionary small, convenient, and affordable ATM. Few in the industry were prepared for the impact that the Triton 9500 series cash dispenser would have. ATMs were now a practical possibility for countless non-bank locations.  In 1997, Triton launched the 9600 series. The machine incorporated a number of ways to help retailers build ATM traffic including an all-new compelling design that allows high-visibility signage and a color screen. Popularity skyrocketed and in 1999, Triton became the second largest ATM manufacturer in the United States, carving a permanent niche in the off-premise market. To date, close to 50,000 Triton 9600 units have been shipped to off-premise locations worldwide.  Triton not only has the technological know-how to solve problems, but also has a rare passion for developing solutions that are as practical and affordable as they are sophisticated.  In 2000, Triton was acquired by Dover Corporation. Dover, an organization with annual revenues $4 billion, is known as a manufacturer of a wide range of proprietary products and components for industrial and commercial use. The Dover philosophy is to acquire businesses that are focused on product quality, innovation, and exceptional customer service with strong management teams in place.  In 2002, Triton surprised the industry again with the development of software solutions that enabled both new and existing Triton ATMs to be capable of numerous popular consumer transactions including the ability to send and receive money transfers, buy prepaid wireless phone minutes, and cash government and payroll checks.  It?s easy to see why Triton is known today as the leading provider of ATMs for off-premise locations. The company has honed its remarkable technology prowess, but ?most important? never lost sight of the fact that affordability, usability, and practicality are as important as technology.  The Triton Advantage  The advantages of owning a Triton ATM begin at the design phase of every product. Our goal is simple?to ensure that you reach the biggest return possible on your investment. This ?maximum return? philosophy has made Triton one the largest off-premise ATM manufacturers in the world, with ATMs ideally suited for financial institutions and retail environments.  Of course, our low-cost, quality ATMs are developed with ease of servicing in mind. And you can see our dedication to reliability in every Triton dispensing mechanism.  With over 158,000 ATMs shipped to 24 countries worldwide, Triton is known for reliable and serviceable units. Thanks to superior engineering, Triton ATMs average less than one service call per year per ATM.  All of Triton?s endeavors are complemented by our parent company, Dover Corporation. This organization has annual revenues of $5 billion and is known as the manufacturer of a wide range of proprietary products and components for industrial and commercial use. Triton maintains this philosophy and takes it one step further in developing products that provide the lowest total cost of ownership in the market today. We?re aware of what customers will experience when servicing or upgrading ATMs and keep that in mind when designing Triton products. We make every effort to further reduce your overhead and increase the revenue generated by your Triton ATMs.  As the industry continues to face more stringent compliance mandates, we feel it?s important to fully understand these implications and quickly make necessary changes for new and existing ATMs. That?s why Triton was the first manufacturer to possess talking ATMs and to meet the triple DES mandate. Both of these features are standard on every model that Triton makes, along with cost-effective, easy-to-install upgrade packages for existing Triton ATMs. Should your Triton ATM not be upgradeable, we offer ?trade-up? units that allow you to extend the life of your original investment.  The Triton Advantage doesn?t stop there. With over 158,000 ATMs shipped to 24 countries worldwide, Triton is known for reliable and serviceable units. Thanks to superior engineering, Triton ATMs average less than one service call per year per ATM. Additionally; more than 90 % of all technical difficulties reported are resolved by telephone. Triton ATMs are famous for their reliability and longevity. Furthermore, we stand behind our ATMs with a large parts inventory. We also offer an extremely thorough education for both the novice and professional, arming you with knowledge to service your own ATM. If you manage a large estate, Triton offers cutting edge ATM monitoring software that puts you in complete control of your ATMs from a personal computer. Our goal is for your ATMs to be trouble free and this monitoring makes it possible.  Triton is committed to providing your products in a timely manner. With options such as same-day shipping and web ordering, Triton is prepared to meet your needs. Each ATM we ship is guaranteed with a 13-month warranty covering every part of the unit. The continued quality of our products is ensured through the utilization of a Quality Management System focused on customer satisfaction and continuous improvement, an ISO 9001:2000 certified manufacturing facility.",,,00550000000vRURAA2,6/13/2007 17:54,00550000000vRURAA2,6/13/2007 18:00,00550000000vRURAA2,6/13/2007 18:00,,,,,,,,,,

The company's communication equipment and software integrates voice and data services for customers including large corporations, government agencies, and small businesses. Avaya's office phone systems incorporate IP telephony, messaging, Web access, and interactive voice response. The company offers a wide array of consulting, integration, and managed services through its Avaya Global Services unit. It sells directly and through distributors, resellers, systems integrators, and telecom service providers. Avaya was acquired by Silver Lake Partners and TPG Capital for $8.2 billion in 2007. Consolidation in the telecommunications equipment sector had fueled speculation that Avaya was a takeover target, either for private equity investors or competitors such as Cisco Systems and Nortel Networks. Silver Lake and TPG paid $17.50 a share to purchase Avaya. In 2008 Avaya announced that Kevin Kennedy, CEO of optical networking specialist JDS Uniphase, will take over as CEO of Avaya in 2009. The company's current CEO, Cisco veteran Charles Giancarlo, will become chairman. Avaya continues to utilize both a direct sales force and partners to market its wares, but the company's sales strategy has seen it place increasing emphasis on building its channel sales. The company has supplemented its internal product development with a string of acquisitions. It bought audio conferencing systems maker Spectel in late 2004, and Nimcat Networks, a developer of peer-to-peer communications software, in 2005.

The Palo Alto Networks founders, management team and board of directors have been key drivers of some of the most important network security companies and related technologies in the last 12+ years, including the invention of Stateful Inspection, hardware-based security, and intrusion prevention. The engineering team brings a proven track record in delivering high quality networking and security solutions at companies like Check Point, NetScreen, McAfee, Juniper Networks, Peribit, and many others.  Palo Alto Networks enables visibility into?and policy-based control over?applications running on enterprise networks.   The problem Enterprise networks are being populated by a new generation of end-user applications, both personal and business oriented, that are designed to evade detection by existing firewalls. These new applications have joined enterprise applications that use similar evasion tactics, albeit in a positive manner, to simplify wide-spread access and speed implementation cycles. The end result is that IT departments cannot identify or control the applications that are flowing in and out of the network. This lack of visibility and control negatively impacts business through:      * Increased liabilities: Regulatory and internal policy compliance, data leakage     * Increased costs: Increased bandwidth consumption, added IT operational expenses     * Increased threats: Viruses, spyware, worms and application vulnerabilities    Our solution Palo Alto Networks has created a next-generation firewall that takes an application-centric approach to traffic classification to enable unmatched application visibility and policy control. Based upon an innovative traffic classification technology called App-ID, the PA-4000 Series accurately identifies and controls applications regardless of port, protocol, SSL encryption or evasive tactic used.   Why existing solutions are ineffective Existing firewalls are based on Stateful Inspection, which employs a port and protocol approach to traffic classification. The problem existing firewall vendors face is the fact that much of their core technology (Stateful Inspection) is over a dozen years old and new applications have found a variety of ways to evade or bypass them with relative ease. Attempts to fix the problem by firewall vendors include 'bolting-on' Intrusion Prevention (IPS) or Deep Packet Inspection as an additional feature have proven unsuccessful, resulting in significant issues with accuracy, performance and management complexity.      * Accuracy: inline deployment and App-ID classification enable the identification of all application traffic, across all ports, all the time - including SSL encrypted traffic and emerging applications.     * Policy: Unified, graphical visualization of all applications on the network fuels centralized definition and enforcement of policy, based on detailed user, group and application-level categorizations. This enables more effective and efficient management of approved applications, while delivering real-time prevention of malicious threats and application vulnerabilities.     * Performance: a purpose-built, high performance network platform with dedicated processing for all major functions ensures total control of good and bad traffic with no performance degradation.    How we are different Starting with a blank slate, the Palo Alto Networks founders took an application-centric approach to traffic classification thereby enabling visibility into-and control over-Internet applications running on enterprise networks. The PA-4000 Series is a next-generation firewall that classifies traffic based on the accurate identification of the application, irrespective of the port, protocol, SSL encryption or evasive tactic used. Key differentiators include.      * The only firewall to classify traffic based on the accurate identification of the application, not just port/protocol information.     * The only firewall to identify, control and inspect SSL encrypted traffic and applications.     * The only firewall to provide graphical visualization of applications on the network with detailed user, group and network-level data categorized by sessions, bytes, ports, threats and time.     * The only firewall with real-time (line-rate, low latency) protection against viruses, spyware and application vulnerabilities based on a stream-based threat prevention engine.     * The only firewall with line-rate, low-latency performance for all services, even under load.     * The only firewall to offer a true in-line transparent deployment option for seamless integration into an existing network infrastructure.    Deployment options The combination of a powerful networking foundation, rich security features and policy-based management brings flexible deployment options to enterprise customers:      * As an application visibility tool: connected to the network via a span port, the PA-4000 Series can monitor traffic in real-time, providing the IT department with exactly which applications are traversing the network.     * In conjunction with an existing firewall: deployed transparently in conjunction with an existing firewall, the PA-4000 Series can provide granular application visibility and control without requiring any changes to the network.     * As a firewall replacement: full support for traditional firewall applications and protocols, combined with a familiar policy management editor and high performance means that the PA-4000 Series can be used as a replacement for existing firewalls.",,,0055000000139EwAAI,1/14/2009 23:13,00550000000vRURAA2,6/17/2014 19:14,00550000000vRURAA2,6/17/2014 19:14,4/21/2010 0:00,,,,,,,,,

Recent advances in lens materials and optics have allowed CooperVision to create proprietary lenses that treat both common and more complicated visual defects. With the acquisition of Ocular Sciences, Inc. in January 2005, CooperVision became the world's third leading contact lens manufacturer, with enhanced technology, expanded global distribution, and greater manufacturing capabilities.   How would you describe Cooper's business strategy?     Cooper is a medical device company operating in two attractive specialty markets: contact lenses in the vision care market through CooperVision, and diagnostics and devices used in women's healthcare through CooperSurgical. In both these markets, we offer proprietary, patented and, where possible, differentiated products. At CooperVision, we develop new products and improve manufacturing processes through research and engineering. Our business development activities focus on geographic expansion and, occasionally, product acquisition. At CooperSurgical, we develop new products internally, license innovative technology and continue to consolidate the highly fragmented women's healthcare market through product and company acquisitions.  How has CooperVision performed related to other contact lens manufacturers?  CooperVision has been the top-performing of the top six companies that dominate the global contact lens market, of those six, we've been the top-performing in the last two years. And we believe that we will continue to be number one this year.  Another way in which CooperVision differs from competitors is in manufacturing.

KKR acted as underwriter along with Credit Suisse Securities (USA), Goldman, Sachs & Co., J.P. Morgan Securities, UBS Securities, ABN AMRO, and FTN Equity Capital Markets. Avago was able to complete its IPO despite declining revenue and a difficult economic environment. The company has been impacted by the financial downturn and forced to restructure some of its operations, as well as to make cuts to its global workforce. The first round of layoffs totaled approximately 475 employees, or 13% of its workforce. The company announced another round of reductions (about 200 jobs) in May 2009. For cost effectiveness, the company has established some operations closer in proximity to its global customers. Yet, even with the economic downturn, the company's revenues increased 12% in Q3 FY2009, due primarily to the growth of its wireless communications and consumer and computing peripherals markets. The company plans to replenish its inventory to support its growth drive. Helping to distribute the company's 7,000-some products around the world are Arrow Electronics and Avnet. The company serves four primary target markets: industrial and automotive electronics, wired infrastructure, wireless communications, and consumer and computing peripherals. The company's top 10 customers represent 54% of its net revenue and include Cisco Systems, Hewlett-Packard, IBM, LG Electronics, Logitech International, Motorola, Samsung Electronics, and Sony Ericsson Mobile Communications, to name a few. In 2008 Avago bought Infineon Technologies bulk acoustic wave business for about $31 million in cash. The product line, which was subsequently discontinued, complemented Avago's film bulk acoustic resonator filtering technologies. The company will utilize the intellectual property assets acquired in the transaction and gain an R&D team in Munich, where Avago has a wireless R&D center. In 2007 the company acquired the polymer optical fiber business of Infineon Technologies. The business, based in Regensburg, Germany, provides optical fiber for automotive infotainment equipment and safety systems. It also provides transmitters and receivers for transportation switching and home broadband services. All manufacturing, marketing, and R&D employees of the Infineon group became Avago employees. Avago's history can be traced back to 1961, when it was the components division of Hewlett-Packard. HP (still a significant customer for Avago) spun off Agilent Technologies in 1999; Avago constituted the semiconductor products division of Agilent. Buyout specialists KKR and Silver Lake Partners purchased Agilent's semiconductor business for about $2.7 billion in 2005 and renamed it Avago Technologies. KKR and Silver Lake, together with Luxembourg investment firm Bali Investments, jointly owned about 64% of Avago.",,,0055000000139EwAAI,7/28/2010 20:51,00550000000vRURAA2,7/21/2014 21:26,00550000000vRURAA2,7/21/2014 21:26,,,,,,,,,,

Through its affiliation with the BCBSA, Premara is able to offer BlueCard coverage to members of its Blue-branded plans traveling in the US and abroad. In the non-Blue realm, Premera's LifeWise Health Plan units offer health plans in Oregon and Washington, and its LifeWise Assurance business provides life and disability coverage in eight states. Other companies run by Premera include Calypso Healthcare Solutions, a provider of claims payment tools and services to health insurers, and Ucentris Insured Solutions, a life and health insurance distributor. The Vivacity subsidiary, which provides wellness services and products, was created in 2009 to serve employers looking to cut health care costs and increase productivity by encouraging a healthier workforce. The company exited the Arizona market in 2009 after experiencing operating losses each year since it formed a for-profit LifeWise Health Plan of Arizona subsidiary to enter that market in 2004. The divisions' remaining 16,000 customer accounts were sold to another insurer, Blue Cross Blue Shield of Arizona. The move came after the Washington state insurance commissioner had scrutinized Premera activities in the state in 2007 and 2008, questioning whether Premera was subsidizing the money-losing subsidiary with rate hikes on Washington consumers. Though its other operating subsidiaries have largely remained profitable, Premera has struggled with losing members in core markets because of increasing competition, as well as economic conditions and rising unemployment rates. The company is working to reverse the trend by introducing new health plans, such as coverage for self-insured employers introduced in 2008. The company also launched a plan for small employer groups in Alaska in 2010. In addition, Premera is increasing focus on its LifeWise Plans, which allow it to offer more individual coverage options. Founded in 1998 through the merger of Medical Service Corporation, a Blue plan covering eastern Washington founded in 1933, and Blue Cross of Washington and Alaska, which was founded in 1945. For several years (starting in 2002), Premera attempted to convert into a for-profit company; it finally abandoned the plan in 2007 after the state's insurance commissioner and Washington health care providers continued to oppose the move.",,,00550000000vRURAA2,5/24/2012 13:51,00550000000vRURAA2,3/29/2017 17:33,00550000000vRURAA2,5/9/2017 22:40,5/8/2017 0:00,,,,,,,,,

Using proprietary technologies, DNA2.0 exploits the synergy between a highly efficient gene synthesis process and new protein optimization technologies. The result allows researchers to use DNA2.0?s synthetic genes quickly and with confidence, ultimately enabling the transformation of each industry it touches. The tools and applications brought to market by DNA2.0 are transforming biology into an engineering discipline.  With a reverence for the interplay between science, technology and nature, DNA2.0 applies its proprietary ProteinGPS? algorithm, which condenses genomic information into mathematical rules on how proteins function. Application of these rules allows for production of physical entities embodying specific features, using the company?s efficient DNA-2-Go? gene synthesis process. The result: precise and robust algorithms that allow for engineering of any measurable property in any protein so that it fulfills the exact functional criteria needed for commercialization while consuming minimal resources.  While pursuing its goal to lead the industry in creating value-added applications through gene synthesis and protein engineering, DNA2.0 has also chosen to emphasize customer service as a critical measure of success. The freely available DNA2.0 software tool Gene Designer and the online Bioinformatic toolbox (picked as Best of the Web by Genetic Engineering News) put all the tools and expertise needed for gene design at the fingertips of the user. The company positions itself as a resource and research partner for its customers, to enable accurate and innovative delivery of specific, immediately useful solutions. Its customers value the individual, Ph.D.-level support they receive from DNA2.0?s sales and support staff, as well as the speed, accuracy, and flexibility with which genes are synthesized and delivered.  Its scientific expertise is undeniable: DNA2.0 has provided tens of thousands of genes to thousands of customers, synthesizing many millions of base pairs. It is by far the most published synthetic gene vendor, providing expert support to and collaborations with scientists. DNA2.0 guarantees researchers high quality synthetic genes, delivered on time, every time.",,,00550000000vRURAA2,6/28/2012 0:39,00550000000vRURAA2,6/28/2012 0:39,00550000000vRURAA2,3/19/2014 21:56,2/3/2014 0:00,,,,,,,,,

Return on assets measures the amount of after tax income the company generates for every one dollar in assets. This can be an excellent fundamental measure of a company's financial condition because it can be compared across market cap sizes for companies in the same industry. Return on assets is a powerful metric that is best used for peers in similar businesses because the structure of the balance sheets will be similar.  Here is a tabular summary of the financial condition data:  Metric 	FFG 	S&P 500 P/E 	13.61 	15 Price/Sales 	2.17 	1.43 Profit Margin 	15.99% 	2.73% Operating Margin 	21.86% 	9.90% Return on Assets 	1.07% 	About 2.5%  FBL Financial Group reported Revenue of $724.53 million in the last year. For context, the company's market cap is $1.57 billion. Quarterly Revenue Growth year-over-year came in at 1.00% and gross profit in the last year of $185.55 million. Any company that shows revenue growth and a positive gross profit exhibits signs of healthy financial condition.  FINANCIAL CONDITION: EARNINGS FBL Financial Group reported EBITDA of $191.14 million and net income of $115.73 million in the last year. That comes out to Diluted EPS of $4.63. Total Cash on hand sits at $36.77 million with $97.00 million in debt. When a firm has enough cash on hand to cover its debt it is in a much stronger financial position than a company that does not.  Finally the company reported Operating Cash Flow of $226.51 million and Levered Free Cash Flow of $168.43 million in the last year. Positive cash flow measures are a sign of strong financial condition while negative cash flow numbers can be a sign of financial weakness unless revenue is growing rapidly.

Our areas of expertise include risk management, insurance placement, strategic planning, benefit plans, executive benefits, wellness initiatives, health population management, fiduciary expertise, human resources, technology, compliance and employee communication.

Specialties  Business Insurance, Employee Benefits, Financial Services, Personal Insurance, Surety Bonds, Individual Medical, Risk Management, Loss Control, Workers'? Compensation, Property and Casualty   On Jan 16, Associated Banc-Corp (ASB) announced the acquisition of Ahmann & Martin Co., a MN-based leading risk and benefits consulting firm. The transaction is approximately valued at $48 million.  As per the deal, Ahmann & Martin will be merged with and into Associated Financial Group, a subsidiary of Associated Banc-Corp. Moreover, key executives of the former will assume important positions in the merged entity. Dean Hildebrandt, CEO of Ahmann & Martin Co., will become the president and CEO; while David Martin, benefits principal of Ahmann & Martin, will assume the role of executive vice president (?EVP?), following the acquisition.  Ahmann, Martin and Hildebrandt will join Associated Financial Group?s board of directors. William M. Bohn, EVP of the acquirer, will serve as the chairman of the new company.  The newly formed company will have more than 370 employees and a client base of nearly 14,000. The merged entity is expected to rank among the top 50 insurance brokers across the U.S., based on 2013 pro forma revenues.  The transaction value is, however, subjected to an increase of $8 million, if any contingencies are met over a defined period. The acquisition is expected to close next month.  Associated Banc-Corp, which is slated to release fourth-quarter and full-year earnings on Jan 22, 2015, is not expected to materially benefit from the acquisition in the next two years. However, the merger is expected to be accretive to the company?s earnings in 2017.  Associated Financial Group, which serves the states of Wisconsin, Minnesota and Illinois, seeks to penetrate further into the Wisconsin market with this acquisition. The company also expects to benefit from Ahmann & Martin?s range of specialized industry-specific solutions. From the clients? perspective, the new entity would provide them with the benefits of centralized management.  Associated Banc-Corp remains well capitalized. It has always been focused on deploying capital through share repurchase. The acquisition comes as a surprise, as the company is not very active with mergers and acquisitions. The last acquisition closed was that of First National Bank of Hudson in Jun 2007.  Since mounting expenses continue to trouble the company, such acquisition activity can add to the woes. Moreover, enhancing footprints in the already tapped Wisconsin market can increase the existing concentration risk, which can adversely affect the company?s financial performance if the regional economy starts faltering. Plus, the long period of time, before the deal can be accretive to earnings, makes the transaction dull.  However, the fresh acquisition might be an indicator of an increase in the company?s M&A activity in the upcoming quarters, which is expected to boost future growth.  Associated Banc-Corp currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Some better-ranked Midwest banks include QCR Holdings Inc. (QCRH), sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), Enterprise Financial Services Corp. (EFSC) and First Merchants Corp. (FRME) ? both carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).
